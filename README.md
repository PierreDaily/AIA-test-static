## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Methods and Tools**

After our first talk, i decided to chalenge myself and build this web page using  **Atomic Design Methodology** for the first time.
To do that I had to choose a modern web framework and a set of tools/technologies that would make my journey easier.

I choose to go with Gatsby, it's a React based framework that allow you to build static web pages using React components.
Static webpages mean better browser compatibilies, especially for browsers like opera mini that come with limited javascript capabilities.

To style our components I am using SASS for crossplatform compatibility, normalize.css and BEM methodology.

To improve code consistency I am using EsLint and Prettier.

Finaly all the component are going to build in an isolated environment using Storybook.
